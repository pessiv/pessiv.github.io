# Me and the world together potentially empowered by AI

I think everyone should have the access to computing power that has in some level
been granted to me. I am in some level able to run Artificial Intelligence software
locally and protect my likeness from being as abused as it could be if things were
different. It would be nice to be able to comfortably run models that are bigger
than 8 billion parameters, but since over half of the wolds population still doesnt
have access to the internet let alone a computer I am not complaining. I am doing
quite okay with the resources that I have right now.

I know there are bigger problems to be solved in many places before we can get to
the world where everyone can enjoy the power of Artificial Intelligence and computers
in general without forgetting the absolute unimaginable wealth of information that
is on the internet for free*, but the internet would help people to get lifesaving
information faster and even maybe help with the costs of education among other things.

There are malicious software companies that are out there only to use predatory
practices to their users. Alot of the website run by Richard Stallman is dedicated to
digging at those companies. So my optimism might be a little misguided but since I'm
not some oracle who just knows everything I am not quite sure about it.

Some people are right now saying that Articial Intelligence will not stay as the
globally loved good and service that it is now and instead it will turn into some
kind of private weapon for only the rich and powerful to use. For the same reason
politicians are now atleast on the left are again advocating for the Universal Basic
Income and because the rich and powerful people are mostly right wing they are
advocating for something as stupid as Universal Basic Compute.

Universal Basic Compute is basically the idea that everyone should have a base level
of computing power at their disposal instead of just straight up money that they could
buy that same thing with to make them work hard for the money in an age where
opportunities are quickly disappearing maybe never to be seen again in any way shape
or form. People who are not even remotely having their basic needs met will not
benefit from having UBC.

So while Artificial Intelligence solutions really seriously do have the potential to
change the world for the better, the things that are very obviously priorized right 
now are not only making peoples livelihoods disappear they are actively killing people
too (for example in Palestine most of the big tech companies are testing solutions for
making people dead and opressed among other things).

## Projects that I want to make

- [ ] An AI thing that is not connected to the internet that helps me to think deeper
- [ ] A GUI to that AI thing
- [ ] A billion dollar company that has no employees
- [ ] A website for Pinkku and its comics
- [ ] A database for helping with my storywriting

## Asterix notes

Nothing is ever free because someone always ends up paying the price, but taxes of
the people in the world and philantropists and hobbyists run alot of the internet
for basically no profit even now still. It's basically free.
