I really want to become some kind of a developer but at this kind of already
emerged world of Artificial Intelligence madness I am not entirely sure of how
I should approach that kind of thing. The latest advice from ThePrimeagen is to
"weaponise my autism" which is to say that I should get really excited about
something to the point of very nearly not caring about anything other than
it and or obsession.
