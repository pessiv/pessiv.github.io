## Thoughts

### Why I am no longer on any mainstream social media service

My main reason for leaving those places behind is that I find the way that they
are run very disrespectful to the user. You can go look up how they are not 
respecting you in a collection of nicely edited lists on Richard Stallmans
website.

The other reasons for leaving those services behind is that:

- US big tech is just as bad as their Chinese counterpart
- I want my freedom back
- I dont want to be subjected to psychological warfare in nearly as big quantities
- I dont want to directly be a part of making war profiteers more money

It's not deeper than this. I just want to read more books and enjoy cozy living.
I hope you are enjoying your life too :)
