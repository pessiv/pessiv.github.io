# Placeholder title

I really want to become some kind of a developer but at this kind of already
emerged world of Artificial Intelligence madness I am not entirely sure of how
I should approach that kind of thing. The latest advice from ThePrimeagen is to
"weaponise my autism" which is to say that I should get really excited about
something to the point of very nearly not caring about anything other than
it and or obsession.

The things that I could in any likelihood start obsessing over in any serious
manner would be pretty limited to programming and mathematics. Not to forget
the slight bits and pieces of philosophy that almost inevitably appear once
you get deep enough into any one of these two topics. This page will from now
on be continued to paragraph by paragraph with text from me being really
excited about something that I have seen or know.

Initial concrete list of things that I would like to do here:

- exploring the mathematical symbols supported by this github pages thing
- mathematically comparing political ideologies
- creating an algorithm for determining who I should vote for
- going through the rust book
- building a real thing in rust
- making a real service with the old spring boot and typescript toolkit
- exploring dart
- exploring python

Really the thing that I should start all of this actual doing something with is
sharing how my current user experience is made because that will clear all of
the doubts that not having my system may or may not bring to the table and all
doubt is pretty much useless if I do not plan to sell you anything which there
is no danger of because I really do not care about you even existing or do not
even know if you do.

So my current linux distro of choice is NixOS and my terminal of choice is
xfce4-terminal which basically correctly already implies that I use xfce as
my desktop environment although I mostly use the terminal for basiacally all
of the important things. As of 13.05.2025 I do not have any custom software
that would ruin your experience of following along with me in the writings
of this thing, whatever this is (your guess is as good as mine).
