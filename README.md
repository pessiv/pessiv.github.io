# About

I'm just a guy who makes software in his free time while dreaming of maybe someday
getting to do some programming in a professional setting. I'm also a Software Engineer
by education, but because the job market at the moment is just horrible I am not very
optimistic about getting a job in this field in any way shape or form at all whatsoever.

Most of my Jam content is scattered around the interwebs and is thus hard to find. I am willing to make an attempt if you the reader want to see something specific though.

# YouTube Videos

## Finnish Game Jam 2016 Demo video

I got to make this video working alongside some extremely amazing people and I wish still to this day that I could do it again.
