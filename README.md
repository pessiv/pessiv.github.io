# Placeholder title

I really want to become some kind of a developer but at this kind of already
emerged world of Artificial Intelligence madness I am not entirely sure of how
I should approach that kind of thing. The latest advice from ThePrimeagen is to
"weaponise my autism" which is to say that I should get really excited about
something to the point of very nearly not caring about anything other than
it and or obsession.

The things that I could in any likelihood start obsessing over in any serious
manner would be pretty limited to programming and mathematics. Not to forget
the slight bits and pieces of philosophy that almost inevitably appear once
you get deep enough into any one of these two topics. This page will from now
on be continued to paragraph by paragraph with text from me being really
excited about something that I have seen or know.

Initial concrete list of things that I would like to do here:

- exploring the mathematical symbols supported by this github pages thing
- mathematically comparing political ideologies
- creating an algorithm for determining who I should vote for
- going through the rust book
- building a real thing in rust
- making a real service with the old spring boot and typescript toolkit
- exploring dart
- exploring python
