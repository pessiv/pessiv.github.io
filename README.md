# About

I'm just a guy who makes software in his free time while dreaming of maybe someday
getting to do some programming in a professional setting. I'm also a Software Engineer
by education, but because the job market at the moment is just horrible I am not very
optimistic about getting a job in this field in any way shape or form at all whatsoever.
