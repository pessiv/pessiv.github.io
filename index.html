                <h2>Figuring out how to pick a next project</h2>
                <p>In the age of AI I have really got no idea of what is supposed to be
                interesting or impressive as a programmer to make as a thing to put on
                this very site that is supposed to eventually become my portfolio.
                There has even been some desperation in me because it has seemed so that
                this truly is the end of the world because of all of the insanity in the
                news and otherwise</p>
                <p>One idea or a plan that almost attempts to answer this question comes
                from the youtuber and or twitch livestreamer ThePrimeagen and it is
                about learning a new programming language. The plan has the following
                steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to advent of code and try to solve a given years tasks</li>
                    <li>Build a web socket server (i.e. chat server)</li>
                    <li>Build a larger project (i.e. interpreter / lexer)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>While that does answer the question of how to pick the very first
                project when you are just getting started it doesnt really answer
                anything beyond that.</p>
                <p>Thankfully a gentle(man|woman|enby) and a scholar called Erin Borders
                has written just the article for that on freecodecamp years ago. That
                article gives the following summed up steps to get good ideas for a
                project:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>List your problems</li>
                    <li>List your desires</li>
                    <li>Think of ways to automate the solutions to both lists</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I think that's pretty much it. Use your head and you will be
                on your merry way to a better you and a better looking portfolio</p>
                <hr>
                <p>I'll be doing both of these plans things with javascript next
                just to let potential employers know that I know javascript even
                though I already know that I know javascript</p>
