# Pinkku Website

I feel like the first step that I should take in making the site would be figuring
out how the making process works. I should google the steps for a complete site with
the search terms "react docs".

By checking out the site react.dev that was the first link that appeared I learned
that:

- Install react
- Look up cool elements made by other people
- Look up a tutorial for making a react site
- Roughly design the site
- Make the site
- Look up hosting options for react

I should install react by creating an app like so:
npm create vite@latest pinkku-website -- --template react

I looked up several react component libraries and I will go through them one by one
